# Balances

Balances currently contains **RING** and **KTON**.

**RING** is system token of Darwinia Network, the initial supply before Darwinia network mainnet release is 2 billion.

**KTON** is the staking and governance credential of Darwinia Network, KTON can **only obtained by locking RING**, the initial supply is 0.

At present, some **RING** and **KTON** exist in the Ethereum network and the Tron network in the form of **ERC-20** and **TRC-20**. These TOKENs will be transferred to the Darwinia main network by 1:1 cross-chain conversion after the Darwinia main online.

**The Balances module provides functions for**

- Getting and setting free balances.
- Retrieving total, reserved and unreserved balances.
- Repatriating a reserved balance to a beneficiary account that exists.
- Transferring a balance between accounts (when not reserved).
- Slashing an account balance.
- Account creation and removal.
- Managing total issuance.
- Setting and managing locks.

## Terminology

- **Existential Deposit:** The minimum balance required to create or keep an account open. This prevents
"dust accounts" from filling storage. When the free plus the reserved balance (i.e. the total balance)
  fall below this, then the account is said to be dead; and it loses its functionality as well as any
  prior history and all information on it is removed from the chain's state.
  No account should ever have a total balance that is strictly between 0 and the existential
  deposit (exclusive). If this ever happens, it indicates either a bug in this module or an
  erroneous raw mutation of storage.

- **Total Issuance:** The total number of units in existence in a system.

- **Reaping an account:** The act of removing an account by resetting its nonce. Happens after its
total balance has become zero (or, strictly speaking, less than the Existential Deposit).

- **Free Balance:** The portion of a balance that is not reserved. The free balance is the only
  balance that matters for most operations.

- **Reserved Balance:** Reserved balance still belongs to the account holder, but is suspended.
  Reserved balance can still be slashed, but only after all the free balance has been slashed.

- **Imbalance:** A condition when some funds were credited or debited without equal and opposite accounting
(i.e. a difference between total issuance and account balances). Functions that result in an imbalance will
return an object of the `Imbalance` trait that can be managed within your runtime logic. (If an imbalance is
simply dropped, it should automatically maintain any book-keeping such as total issuance.)

- **Lock:** A freeze on a specified amount of an account's free balance until a specified block number. Multiple
locks always operate over the same funds, so they "overlay" rather than "stack".


## Usage

### transfer balances

Transfer some liquid free balance to another account.

`transfer` will set the `FreeBalance` of the sender and receiver.
It will decrease the total issuance of the system by the `TransferFee`.
If the sender's account is below the existential deposit as a result
of the transfer, the account will be reaped.

### set balances

Set the balances of a given account.

This will alter `FreeBalance` and `ReservedBalance` in storage. it will
also decrease the total issuance of the system (`TotalIssuance`).
If the new free or reserved balance is below the existential deposit,
it will reset the account nonce (`frame_system::AccountNonce`).

The dispatch origin for this call is `root`.

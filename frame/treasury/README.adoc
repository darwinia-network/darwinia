# Treasury Module

The Treasury module provides a "pot" of funds that can be managed by stakeholders in the
system and a structure for making spending proposals from this pot.

- `treasury::Trait`
- `Call`

## Overview

The Treasury Module itself provides the pot to store funds, and a means for stakeholders to
propose, approve, and deny expenditures.  The chain will need to provide a method (e.g.
inflation, fees) for collecting funds.

By way of example, the Council could vote to fund the Treasury with a portion of the block
reward and use the funds to pay developers.

### Terminology

- **Proposal:** A suggestion to allocate funds from the pot to a beneficiary.
- **Beneficiary:** An account who will receive the funds from a proposal iff
the proposal is approved.
- **Deposit:** Funds that a proposer must lock when making a proposal. The
deposit will be returned or slashed if the proposal is approved or rejected
respectively.
- **Pot:** Unspent funds accumulated by the treasury module.
